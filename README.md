# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-PowerBi-Project

## Project Aim:
- The aim of this HR Analytics Dashboard project is to provide a comprehensive and interactive analysis of employee attrition within an organization.
- By leveraging data visualization techniques, the dashboard aims to uncover critical insights into attrition patterns, identify key factors contributing to employee turnover, and facilitate data-driven decision-making to improve employee retention strategies.


### Project Objectives:
## Visualize Key Metrics:
- Display essential HR metrics such as the total number of employees, total attrition, attrition rate, average age, average salary, and average years of service to provide an overview of the workforce composition and attrition trends.

## Analyze Attrition by Demographics: 
- Break down attrition data by various demographic factors including age, gender, education, and job roles to identify groups with higher turnover rates and understand the underlying causes.

## Identify High-Risk Groups:
- Highlight specific groups, such as age groups, job roles, or salary brackets, that experience higher attrition rates, allowing HR managers to target retention efforts more effectively.

## Assess Job Satisfaction: 
- Evaluate job satisfaction levels across different roles to pinpoint areas where job satisfaction is low and attrition is high, providing insights for targeted interventions.

## Examine Attrition Trends Over Time: 
- Track attrition trends over different periods (e.g., years at the company) to identify critical periods where employees are more likely to leave, enabling the development of strategies to improve employee retention during these times.

## Support Data-Driven Decision Making: 
- Equip HR leaders and managers with actionable insights derived from the data to inform policies, programs, and initiatives aimed at reducing employee turnover and enhancing overall job satisfaction.
